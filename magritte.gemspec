  s.description = <<-EOS 
  Magritte is a simple but powerful wrapper to Open3 pipes that makes it easy to handle two-way piping of data into and out of a sub-process. Various input IO wrappers are supported and output can either be to an IO or to a block. A simple line buffer class is also provided, to turn block writes to the output block into line-by-line output to make interacting with the sub-process easier.
